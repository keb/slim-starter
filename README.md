# Slim 4 Starter

A starter project that includes a templating engine (league/plates), a dependency injection container (php-di/php-di), a static analyzer (vimeo/psalm), a testing framework (phpunit/phpunit), and a basic application boilerplate.

Also included is a docker-compose config that creates containers for `php:fpm-alpine`, `nginx:alpine`, `mariadb:latest`, and `composer:latest`. MariaDB is uncommented by default in the `docker-compose.yml`.
